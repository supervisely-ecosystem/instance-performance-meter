# Overview

The Instance Performance Meter is an application designed to measure the performance of a Supervisely instance by conducting tests over a specified number of iterations. It provides detailed statistics for each important method on every iteration as well as overall project processing metrics.

# Key Features

The Instance Performance Meter offers several key features to enhance the performance measurement process:

-   Can only be used by instance administrators
-   The application does not have an interface, but you can open a page to view real-time logs with rendered tables
-   Upon completion of the tests, a file will be created in Team Files where you can view the results in a convenient format without needing to download it
-   In the current version, standard methods for downloading and uploading projects are tested
-   `Coming soon`: new methods with increased load will be added

# How to Use

1. Launch the application and select the number of iterations.
2. Open the application page to view real-time logs.

    Alternatively, you can wait for the execution to complete and open the report.
